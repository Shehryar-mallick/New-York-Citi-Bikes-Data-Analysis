# New-York-Citi-Bikes-Data-Analysis

Carried out data preprocessing and analysis using google sheets on the New York Citi Bikes Data to answer the following key questions that would help the stakeholders in making better business decision.
The questions were:
1.	What are the most popular locations across the city for NY Citi Bike rental?
2.	How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups, and over time?
3.	Which age group rents the most bikes?
4.	How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
